    print("Equal")
else:
    print("Smaller")
```

264. **How do you use nested conditions in Python?**
     * Nested conditions involve placing one `if` statement inside another.
       Example:

if x > 10:
    if x < 20:
        print("x is between 10 and 20")
```

265. **What is the break statement used for in Python loops?**
     * The `break` statement terminates the loop prematurely.

266. **What is the continue statement used for in loops?**
     * The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

267. **What is the purpose of a while loop in Python?**
     * A `while` loop repeatedly executes code as long as a condition is `True`.

268. **How does a for loop work in Python?**
     * A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or tuple) and executes a block of code for each item.

269. **What is the difference between for and while loops?**
     * A `for` loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known, while a `while` loop runs as long as a condition is `True`.

270. **How do you iterate over a string using a loop?**
     * Use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the string:

```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

271. **What is the range() function used for in loops?**
     * `range()` generates a sequence of numbers, often used to control the number of iterations in a loop.

272. **What is a nested loop?**
     * A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. It is useful when iterating over multi-dimensional structures, like lists of lists.

273. **How do you use else with a loop in Python?**
     * An `else` block can be used after a loop to execute code if the loop completes without hitting a `break` statement.

274. **What is a Boolean expression in Python?**
     * A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`.

275. **What is the modulus operator used for in Python?**
     * The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division.

276. **What is the use of logical operators in conditions?**
     * Logical operators combine multiple conditions to form a complex condition.

277. **What is short-circuiting in logical operators?**
     * Short-circuiting occurs when Python stops evaluating a logical expression as soon as the result is determined (e.g., `True and ...` stops evaluating because it’s already `True`).

278. **How do you create a while loop that runs indefinitely?**
     * Use `while True:` to create an infinite loop, often used in server programs or when waiting for user input.

279. **How do you use a for loop to iterate over a list?**

```python
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

280. **What is an infinite loop in Python?**
     * An infinite loop is a loop that never ends unless externally interrupted or broken using a `break` statement.
       
281. **What is a function in Python?**
     * A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help in making code modular and more manageable.

282. **How do you define a function in Python?**
     * Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.
       Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

283. **What are parameters in a Python function?**
     * Parameters are variables listed in the function definition, which receive values when the function is called.

284. **What are arguments in a Python function?**
     * Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when calling it.

285. **What is the difference between parameters and arguments?**
     * Parameters are placeholders in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed during the function call.

286. **What is the return statement used for in functions?**
     * The `return` statement is used to exit the function and return a value to the caller.

287. **How do you call a function in Python?**
     * To call a function, simply use the function name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments.
       Example: `greet("Alice")`

288. **What are default arguments in Python functions?**
     * Default arguments are parameters that take a predefined value if no argument is passed when calling the function.
       Example:

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

289. **What is a recursive function in Python?**
     * A recursive function is one that calls itself in order to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

290. **What are the advantages of recursion?**
     * Recursion allows for elegant solutions to problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversal, factorial calculation, and Fibonacci numbers.

291. **What are the disadvantages of recursion?**
     * Recursion can lead to high memory usage due to function call stack, and it may result in stack overflow if the base case is not defined or if the recursion depth is too deep.

292. **What is the base case in a recursive function?**
     * The base case is the condition that stops the recursion, preventing infinite recursion.

293. **How do you avoid recursion errors in Python?**
     * Ensure that the base case is well-defined and that recursion moves towards it in each call.

294. **What is the max() function used for in Python?**
     * The `max()` function returns the largest item from an iterable or from two or more arguments.

295. **What is the min() function used for in Python?**
     * The `min()` function returns the smallest item from an iterable or from two or more arguments.

296. **What is the round() function used for in Python?**
     * The `round()` function rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer or to a specified number of decimal places.

297. **What is the abs() function used for in Python?**
     * The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number, i.e., its distance from zero.

298. **What is the pow() function in Python?**
     * The `pow()` function returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number. It also has an optional third argument for modulus.

299. **What are the built-in mathematical functions in Python?**
     * Some common built-in mathematical functions include `abs()`, `max()`, `min()`, `pow()`, `round()`, `sum()`, and `divmod()`.

300. **How do you import a function from another module?**
     * Use the `import` statement to include functions from other modules.
       Example:

```python
from math import sqrt
```
the `min()` function on the values: `min(d.values())`.

360. **What is the difference between del and pop() in dictionaries?**
* `del` removes a key-value pair, and `pop()` also removes and returns the value associated with the key.

361. **How do you create a tuple in Python?**
* Use parentheses: `t = (1, 2, 3)`.

362. **How do you access elements in a tuple?**
* Use indexing: `t[0]`.

363. **How do you find the length of a tuple?**
* Use the `len()` function: `len(t)`.

364. **Can you modify the contents of a tuple in Python?**
* No, tuples are immutable. You cannot change their contents.

365. **How do you concatenate two tuples?**

* Tuple unpacking allows you to assign the values in a tuple to separate variables.
  Example:

  ```python
  t = (1, 2, 3)
  a, b, c = t
  ```

368. **How do you convert a list to a tuple?**
* Use the `tuple()` function: `t = tuple(lst)`.

369. **How do you create a tuple with one item?**
* Add a comma after the item: `t = (1,)`.

370. **How do you iterate through a tuple?**
* Use a `for` loop:

```python
for item in t:
    print(item)
```

371. **What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?**
* Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed), while lists are mutable (can be changed).

372. **How do you check if a tuple contains duplicate elements?**
* Convert the tuple to a set and compare the lengths:

```python
len(t) != len(set(t))
```

373. **How do you find the maximum and minimum values in a tuple?**
* Use the `max()` and `min()` functions:
  `max(t)` and `min(t)`.

374. **What is the count() method used for in tuples?**
* The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in a tuple.
* 
375. **How do you convert a tuple to a string in Python?**
* Use the `join()` method after converting the tuple elements to strings:

```python
''.join(map(str, t))
```

376. **How do you remove an item from a tuple?**
* Tuples are immutable, so you cannot remove items directly. You can create a new tuple with the items you want to keep.

377. **What is the index() method used for in tuples?**
* The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the tuple.

378. **How do you slice a tuple in Python?**
* Use slicing syntax: `t[start:end]`.

379. **What is a nested tuple?**
* A nested tuple is a tuple that contains other tuples as elements.
